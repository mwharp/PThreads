# PThreads
This assignment was a two person lab from Operating Systems that taught how PThreads worked. My partner and I were able to correct eachother when we were confused on something or did something wrong. Learning PThreads helped me learn more about OS, specifically Linux, and how I am able to work with another person to work together to complete a assingment correctly when we are both a bit confused on how exactly to code it.
